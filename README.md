# Project: Alchemy
*A interactive tool for time series experimentation*

Alchemy is an open-source framework that aims to make it **easier to model and experiment time series analysis and forecasting**. Alchemy offers a intuitive and interactive interface to explore different parameters for models using Autoregressive models (AR, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA, ARIMAX, and SARIMAX). More estimators and algorithms

# Getting started
Alchemy can be used in three different ways:

## Web
If you are just curious about what you can do with Alchemy, **[you can refer to this website](COLOCAR_LINK)**. We also provide an one-click deploy with Heroku, so you can use Alchemy in your own cloud account. **Your first compute instance on Heroku is free**.

## Docker
Run the following commands to use Alchemy with Docker (requires **Docker and Docker-compose**):


```bash
# To use the upload function, we need access to the server 
sudo apt-get install x11-xserver-utils
xhost +

# Run the docker compose
docker-compose up --build
```

## Local installation (requirements.txt)
**Tip**: we recommend you to use Anaconda environments

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/paulozip/alchemy.git
cd alchemy

# If you're using Anaconda
conda create --name alchemy_env
conda activate alchemy_env

# Install dependencies
pip install requirements.txt

# Run Streamlit
streamlit run run.py
```

# Your data, your code
At the end of the process, Alchemy will give you the source code used to make the exploration and training. Use this code to adapt your work and make modifications at will:

# Next steps
Currently, this is an one-person project, but help is always welcome. **[You can suggest new ideas and features for us in our issue tracking](https://github.com/paulozip/alchemy/issues). Requests will be prioritized by thumbs up emoji** (üëç).

**If you want to collaborate with this project**, all you need to do is fork this repository, make new additions and modifications, and open a PR. I will validate it ASAP.
